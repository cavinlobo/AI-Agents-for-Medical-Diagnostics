With the emergence of transformer models, these tasks have witnessed remarkable advancements. Transformers, which revolutionized natural language processing in 2017, have now found applications in medical imaging DL models. Adopting transformers has led to enhanced performance in various medical imaging competitions. In this report, I focus on benchmarking the top Kaggle solutions in classification, object detection, and segmentation for advanced medical imaging modalities such as MRI, CT, and X-rays. Specifically, I will emphasize recent deep learning-based methods for these tasks, highlighting their methodology designs and performances in handling volumetric imaging data. By reviewing and analyzing these top solutions, I aim to provide insights for our community on effectively adapting artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for medical imaging.

Prominent CNN architectures such as ResNets, EfficientNets, and DenseNets have shown great performance in classification. YOLOs and R-CNNs have proven their effectiveness in object detection, while U-Nets dominate segmentation shown in <b>Figure 2, 3</b>. In contrast, RNN architectures like LSTM and GRU have shown great performance in analyzing sequential medical images, such as video or dynamic medical imaging modalities like functional MRI (fMRI) shown in <b>Figure 2, 3</b>. Although Vision Transformers have recently emerged and replaced convolutions with a complex attention mechanism, which has exceeded the performance of CNNs in many tasks, they need enormous amounts of training data, even more than CNNs. Due to the lack of medical image data, they are not commonly used in medical imaging competitions shown in<b> Figure 3</b>. Nevertheless, the potential of Vision Transformers in medical imaging analysis remains promising. As the availability of annotated medical image datasets increases, these models may become more prevalent and demonstrate their full capabilities in solving challenging medical imaging tasks.</span>\n",

Specifically, CNNs have primarily been employed for classification and object detection tasks since they are excellent feature extractors. Therefore, it can be utilized to classify medical images and avoid complicated and expensive feature engineering <a href='https://journalofbigdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40537-019-0276-2'>[3]</a>. In contrast, UNet, the most widespread image segmentation architecture, has achieved tremendous attention from academic and industrial researchers <a href='https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.14830.pdf'>[4]</a>. As a result, UNets have emerged as highly effective tools for segmentation tasks across various medical image modalities, as shown in <b>Figure 5</b>.</span>"

Over the past few years, Kaggle has provided a great platform with various real-life medical image datasets to benchmark algorithms. Deep learning methods, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and UNet models, have shown their effectiveness in dealing with various medical image modalities such as MRI, CT scans, and X-rays in these competitions. Recently, the emergence of Vision Transformers has shown some promising applications, including medical image analysis. Nevertheless, despite their potentials, Vision Transformers are not widely used in medical imaging competitions.</span>\n",
